          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            At this bakery, we believe baking is both an art and a passion.
            Based in delhi, we craft 100% eggless, homemade cakes, loaded with
            premium ingredients and made with love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founder started this to bring joy through rich flavors and
            aestheticsâ€”from Ferrero-loaded cakes to Belgian chocolate rosettes.
